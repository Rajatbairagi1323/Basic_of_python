# ----- IDENTIFIERS -----

# A name in python program is called identifiers.
# It can be class name or function name or module name or variable name.

# a = 10


# --RULES TO DEFINE IDENTIFIERS IN PYTHON--

# 1) The only only allowed character in python are :--

# * Alphabate symbols (either lower case or upper case)
# * digits(0 to 9) 
# * underscore symbol(_).

# By mistake if we are using any other symbol like $ then we will get syntax error.

# * cash=10 correct
# * ca$h=20 wrong because python are not allow to use dollor symbol



# 2) Identifiers should not start with digit.

# 123total wrong
# total123 correct


# 3) Identifiers are case sensitive of course python language is case sensitive language.

total = 10
TOTAL = 1000
print(total) #----> 10
print(TOTAL) #----> 1000



# ---IDENTIFIERS---

# 1) Alphabet symbol (Either upper case or lower case )
# 2) If identifiers is started underscore (_) then it indicates it is private.
# 3) Identifiers should not start with Digits.
# 4) Identifiers are case sensitive.
# 5) we cannot used reserved words as indentifiers.  EX. def=10 wrong
# 6) There is no length limit for python identifiers. But not recommended use too lengthy identifiers.
# 7) Dollor ($) symbol is not allowed in python.



# Which of the following are vaild python identifiers?

# 123total -->  wrong
# total123  --> right
# java2share --> right 
# ca$h --> wrong
# _abc_abc_ --> right
# def --> wrong because it is keyword
# if --> wrong because it is keywords



# ---NOTE---


# 1) If identifiers start with _ symbol then it indicates that is private.
# 2) If identifiers start with __ two underscore symbol it indicating that strongly private identifiers.
# 3) If the identifiers starts and ends that identifiers is language defined special name which is also known as (MAGIC METHODS).
# EX. --> __add__
