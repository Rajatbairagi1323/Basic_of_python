# ---Features of python---


# 1) SIMPLE AND EAST TO LEARN--


# python is a simple programming language when we read python program, use can feel like reading english statements.
# the syntax are very simple and noly 30+ keywords are available.
# when compared with other language we can write program with very less number of lines. Hence more readible and simplicity.
# we can reduce development and coast of the project.


# 2) FREEWARE AND OPEN SOURCE--

# we can use python without licence and it is freeware.
# its source code is open, so that we can costomize based on our requirement.
# EX- jython is customized virson of python to work with java applications.



# 3) HIGH LEVEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE--

# python is high level programming language and hence it is programmer friendly language being programmer we are not required to concentrate 
# low level activities like memory management and security etc.



# 4) PLATFORM INDEPENDENT--

# once we write python program, it can run on any platform without rewriting once again internally. PVM is responsible to convert into 
# machine understable form.



# 5) PORTABILITY--

# python programs are portable .ie we can migrate from one platform to another platform very easily. python program will provide same result on any 
# platform.



# 6) DYNAMICALLY TYPED--

# In python we are not required to declare type for variable. whenever we are assinging the value, based on value, type will be allocated
# automatically. Hence python is considered as dynamically typed language.
# But java, C etc are statically typed language because we have to provide type at beginning only.
# this dynamic typing nature will provide more flexibility to the programmer.



# 7) BOTH PROCEDURE ORIENTED AND OBJECT ORIENTED--

# python language support both procedure oriented like (C, pascal) etc.. and object oriented like (C++, java) features, Hence we can get benefits
# of both like security and reusability etc.



# 8) INTERPRETED--
	
# we are not required to compile python programs explicitly. Internally python interpreter will take care that complilation.
# Its compailation fails interpreter raised syntax error. once compilation success the PVM (python virtual machine) is responsible to execute.



# 9) Extensible--

# we can use other language programs in python are:
# * we can use already existing legacy non - python code.
# * we can improve performance of the application.



# 10) EMBEDDED--

# we can use python programs in any other language programs. i.e.. we can embedded python programs anywhere.




# 11) EXTENSIVE LIBRABY--

# python has a rich inbuit library.
# Being a programmer we can use this library directly and we are not responsible to implement the funcationality etc..




# ------LIMITATIONS OF PYTHON------

# performance wise not up to mark because it is interpreter language.
# not using for mobile applications.




# --- FLAVOURS OF PYTHON ---


# 1) CPython--

# It is the standard flavours of python. It can be used to work with C language applications.


# 2) Jython/JPython--

# It is for java application. It can be run on JVM (java virtual machine).


# 3) IronPython--

# It is for C #. Net platform.


# 4) PyPy--

# The main advantage of PyPy is performance will be improved because JIT (just-in-time) compiler is availabe inside PVM.


# 5) RubyPython--

# for Ruby platform.


# 6) AnacondaPython--

# It is specially designed for handling large volume of data processing.






# ----- PYTHON VERSION -----


# python 1.0 version introduced in jan 1994.

# python 2.0 version introduced in october 2000.

# python 3.0 version introduced in december 2008.



# NOTE:--


# python 3 won't provide backward compatibility to python 2. i.e.. there is no gurantee that python2 program will be run in python3.


# current version 

# python --> 3.6.1       python --> 3.7.0
