# Language Fundamentals

# --Introduction--

# python is a general purpose high level programming language.
# python was developed by Guido Van Rossam in 1998 while working at National Research institude at Neatherland.
# But offially python was made available  to public in 1991. The official date of birth for python is : Feb 20th 1991.
# python is recommended as first programming language for  beginner.



# To print HelloWorld :-

# Java

# 1) public class HelloWorld
# 2)     {
# 3)     p s v main (string[]args)
# 4)      {
# 5)       SOP('HelloWorld');
# 6)      }
# 7)        }



# C

# 1) # include<studio.h>
# 2) void main()
# 3) {
# 4)   print("HelloWorld");
# 5) }



# python


print("HelloWorld")



# python sum of two numbers


a=10
b=20
print("The sum":,(a+b))



# The name python was selected from the TV show -- THE COMPLETE MONTY PYTHON'S CIRCUS -- which was broadcaster in BBC from 1969 to 1974.


# Guido developed python language by taking almost all programming features from different languages.

# 1-- Functional programming features from C.
# 2-- object oriented programming features from C++.
# 3-- Modular programming features from modula -3.
  
  
# Most of syntax in python Derived from C and ABC languages.





# Where we can use python.

# We can use everywhere. The most comman important application areas are :-

# 1) for developing desktop applications.
# 2) for developing web applications.
# 3) for developing database applications.
# 4) for networking porgramming.
# 5) for developing games.
# 6) for data analysis applications.
# 7) for machine learning.
# 8) for developing artificial intelligence applications.
# 9) for IOT.



# --Note--

# Internally google and youtube use python coding.
# NASA and Nework stock exchange applications develop by python.
# Top software companies like google, microsoft, IBM, yahoo using python.
